#Image Processing Toolbox

This repository contains a collection of image processing techniques implemented using OpenCV in Python. Below is an overview of the functionalities available in this toolbox:

Functionalities:

Image Resizing:
Enlarging and shrinking images to desired dimensions.
Image Flipping:
Rotation by 90 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise.
Rotation by 180 degrees.
Horizontal and vertical flipping.
Blending and Transition:
Blending two images together for a smooth transition.
Arithmetic Operations:
Multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division of pixel values.
Bitwise Operations:
AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations between images.
Thresholding:
Segmenting images into binary regions based on pixel intensity.
Edge Detection:
Identifying edges in images using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Usage:

Each functionality is implemented as a separate Python script within the repository. To use a specific functionality:

Run the corresponding Python script.
Follow the instructions or customize the script as needed.
View the results displayed using OpenCV's imshow function.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
